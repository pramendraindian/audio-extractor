microphone-poc-results
The "Error: could not access audio input device" message indicates that the Python script was unable to find or connect to a microphone on the system 

where it's being executed. This is a common issue in Google Colab because Colab notebooks run on virtual machines in the cloud, 

not directly on your local computer. Therefore, these virtual machines do not have access to your local computer's microphone.
